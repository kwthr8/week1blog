                    <p>He said “I wanted to communicate to as many people as possible, but also to make a popular form
                        of art that was more personal and less manipulative. I had to find out more about how the
                        process worked. The only way possible was to go to college and learn it.” Neville Brody is
                        inspired by Dadaism and pop art, it has largely influenced his work over the years.
